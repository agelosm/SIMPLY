SIMPLY was implemented at Spring Semester of 2010, at University of Ioannina, under the guidance of professor Vasileios Dimakopoulos.

In order to compile and run:
* make all
* ./simplyrun 4 pi

In the example above, 'pi' is a simple parallelized pi approximation algorithm, using SIMPLY's message passing functions instead of the MPI ones.
